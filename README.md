A very simple application to find github repository using github API made with ReactJS.

simply run the commands below to install all depedencies and start the app (served in PORT 3000)
```
npm install

npm run start
```

due to Github API request limitation, create an `.env` file with options below to make unlimited requests.
```
REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```
